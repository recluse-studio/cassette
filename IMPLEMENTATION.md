# IMPLEMENTATION.md — Cassette execution queue

This file is the order and state authority for building Cassette. AGENTS.md governs how code is
written; this file governs what is built next, what is already done, and when an agent stops.
The step queue below is the implementation counterpart of research/QUESTION_QUEUE.md: numbered,
dependency-ordered, machine-checkable, resumable.

## Execution protocol

**Command grammar.** The principal issues commands like "Execute S01 through S05", "execute the
next five steps", or "continue the queue". An agent executes the named range in order and does
not stop between steps.

**Straight line.** Work proceeds forward only. A step marked DONE is never reopened unless a
later step's invariant fails and names it, or a review names a failing invariant against the
step's own rows — a regression reopens through a named failing invariant, never through
preference, style, or refactoring appetite.

**Per-step ritual.**
1. Read this file. Find the step. Verify its depends are DONE.
2. Make the step's invariants pass with the smallest change (AGENTS.md workflow).
3. Run done_when: the full test suite plus tools/ledger, not just the step's tests. Green means
   green everywhere — regressions never accumulate silently.
4. Before marking the step DONE, list every acceptance clause named by the step. For each clause,
   record the exact test or probe, the exact input changed or failure injected, the expected
   result, and the observed result. A test name or total passing-test count is not evidence. Any
   missing clause keeps the step IN_PROGRESS.
5. Close in two commits, because a commit cannot contain its own hash: first the step commit
   (code and tests), then a close commit that sets this file's status to DONE with date and the
   step commit's hash. Every commit — step, close, repair, docs — answers the AGENTS.md commit
   test; close-commit answers may be short but must exist, and tools/ledger enforces this
   mechanically for every commit after the law baseline. The queue authority is never left dirty.

**Resume ritual (agent restart, platform restart, new session).**
1. Read this file top to bottom. The queue statuses are ground truth; git log corroborates.
2. Re-run done_when for the most recent DONE step. If green, continue at the first TODO whose
   depends are satisfied and whose env matches the platform. If red, that step reverts to
   IN_PROGRESS and is finished first.
3. Never redo DONE work. Never start a step whose depends are not DONE.

**Loop guards.**
- Attempt budget: three materially distinct approaches per step. If the third fails, set status
  BLOCKED with a report — what was tried, exact errors, the suspected cause, the invariant that
  will not pass — then continue with the next step that does not depend on it. Blocked is a
  recorded state, never a silent skip.
- Scope lock: touch only the step's listed files, plus discovered files recorded with one-line
  reasons. Work not demanded by the step's invariants is deferred to its own step or deleted.
- Size tripwire: exceeding roughly twice the step's expected size means stop and re-read the
  ledger contract — the design is being fought, and the contract wins.
- No polishing loops: formatting, renaming, and restructuring of DONE code are defects unless a
  named invariant demands them.

**Check-in policy.** Stopping to ask the principal is rare and reserved for: a remit-level
decision the ledger genuinely does not answer; credentials, purchases, or physical hardware; two
steps BLOCKED on the same root cause; or an action that is destructive or irreversible outside
this repository. Everything else is decided from the ledger, recorded in the step's notes, and
the work continues.

**Phase boundary.** PHASE MACHINE contains every step buildable and verifiable by agents alone:
scratch cartridges are APFS disk images, sources are deterministic fixture servers, storage
profiles are simulated from recorded class data, and small real models are downloaded by the
agent where a step says so. No PHASE MACHINE step asks the principal to test, plug in, or
observe anything. PHASE LIVE is one campaign, run with the principal present, against real
drives, real transfers, and the real matrix. It begins only when every PHASE MACHINE step is
DONE or BLOCKED-with-report.

**Environments.** env: any — runs anywhere Python runs. env: macos — requires Apple Silicon
(MLX/Metal, F_FULLFSYNC). env: macos+hardware — PHASE LIVE only. An agent on the wrong platform
takes the next eligible step or reports; it does not simulate a platform it lacks and call it
proven.

        expected: "Before the pointer swap, remount exposes generation 1 and its exact parent bytes. From a persisted pointer swap onward, remount exposes generation 2 and its exact child bytes. Repeating the journal transition after death is idempotent; no candidate root becomes callable early."
        observed: "Eighteen writer processes were killed and followed by eighteen APFS detach/reattach cycles. Every remount before SWAP_GENERATION_POINTER selected generation 1 and b'parent-generation-bytes'; every remount from the swap through COMMITTED selected generation 2 and b'exact-child-generation'.

Across the first five transitions, also kill inside durable journal replacement after write, readback, F_FULLFSYNC, os.replace, and directory sync. Keep one parent-root reader running for 200 reads during every killed writer."
        expected: "Before journal replacement, recovery repeats the prior transition without losing the completed idempotent action; after replacement, it resumes from the new transition.

        observed: "The invalid source returned INVALID_REQUEST with segment and parity unchanged. Repair without a source named only the alpha page UNAVAILABLE; run admission returned PAGE_CORRUPT with that page object_id. Exact source bytes restored page, parity, root, and availability."

## Status vocabulary

TODO, IN_PROGRESS (with started date), DONE (with date and commit hash), BLOCKED (with report:
approaches tried, exact errors, suspected cause, failing invariant). No other statuses exist.
A BLOCKED step is revisited only when its root cause is resolved by a later step or a recorded
decision — never by retrying the same approach a fourth time.
